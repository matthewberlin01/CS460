This is the Syntactical Analyzer for Project 2
CS 460 - Fall 2022.

Written by: Matthew Berlin

How it works: Given a .ss file as an input, the program will create three files: a .lst, .p1, and .p2. The .lst contains a listing
of the input file, along with the number of errors encountered in the input file. The .p1 contains all of the terminal characters encountered by
the LexicalAnalyzer within the input file, along with the characters associated with the terminal character. The .p2 file contains a listing of all the
rules called by the SyntacticalAnalyzer to determine if the input file is syntactically correct.

What works: Based on my testing of the given P2-1 and P2-2, the Syntactical Analyzer is able to reproduce the expected outputs for P2-#.lst, P2-#.p1, and P2-#.p2

What doesn't work: I was not able to find any bugs within my program that resulted in any erroneus output.
