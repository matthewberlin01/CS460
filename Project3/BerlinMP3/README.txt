Project 3 Updated Object Class
CS 460 - Fall 2022.

Written by: Matthew Berlin

How it works: The Object Class has been updated to allow for boolean literals and rational types to be represented. The Object Class
a general type that allows for different types to interact with one another in a seamless fashion. The goal of the Object Class is 
to better represent how types work in scheme. That is, the Object class acts as an unspecified type that will auto identify what it's
type should be. With the provided ss2cpp and run2 files, a scheme file can be auto generated into c++ code, and the Object Class will
allow the c++ code to act in the same manner as the scheme code.

What works: Based on my testing, Examples1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 all produce the exact same output for the scheme and c++ auto generated code.

What doesn't work: I could not find any issues with my Object Class with the given test cases.
